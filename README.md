Pacman

>HTML Structure:

   The code sets up a basic HTML5 structure with a <div> element named "box" serving as the container for the Pac-Man animation.
>JavaScript:
   An array arr holds the file names of Pac-Man images used for animation.
   The Pac-Man image source is updated to create the mouth-open/close animation effect.
   The position variable is adjusted based on direction and velocity, causing Pac-Man to move back and forth.
   Pac-Man's position and styling are updated dynamically within the "box" container.
   setInterval is used to repeatedly call the moving function every 500 milliseconds, creating the animation effect.
